# CityLights 
Sarajevo Smart City Light is a trail-blazing project which makes the best out of easily affordable technologies and Internet of Things to make life in Sarajevo more advanced and economical. Citizens of Sarajevo will not have to pay through the nose anymore when they are taking care of their electric bill, as this project has significant savings in sight.

Simply by using solar panels to store electrical energy during the day â€“ the same energy could be later used to supply city lighting LEDs, we have also implemented in our project to make major savings. Motion detector has also been installed in pair with each set of LEDs on different locations, to provide additional savings by automatically turning the diodes off when no motion is detected, thus cutting down the redundant usage of energy. Arduino board is among components we have found useful for our project as well, as its sensors proved to be a great way to measure temperature, particles and humidity levels. As arduino boards are connected to web server at all times, those measurements are instantly displayed on the web application through live map and dynamic spline charts. User support would not have been complete without apps for Windows and Apple handheld devices, which allow users to accurately monitor sensor readings on every location, on the go. Last but not least, it is of great importance to mention the Green Arena movement as something we are all extremelly proud of. This movement is our attempt to stimulate citizens of Sarajevo to actively take part in the process of making a smarter Sarajevo, and all they need to do is install an arduino board near their home, so they can track down air pollution levels for their location directly from our website. Citizens can make a real difference through all sorts of eco-actions, subsequently putting their street on the map as the least polluted street in the area.

To sum up, if everything goes as planed, it is quite reasonable to expect that the amount of money city uses to provide energy for street lighting will dramatically drop at the end of the year. Numbers will go around 30-40% in the short term, and 70-80% on the long run, therefore making citizens content and their wallets thicker.
